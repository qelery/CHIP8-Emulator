# CHIP8 Emulator
My CHIP-8 emulator built in Java.

[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) was an interpreted programming language, developed in the mid-1970s to allow video games to be more easily programmed for the computers of its time. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine.
